INFO:Xst:3019 - HDL ADVISOR - 4096 flip-flops were inferred for signal <INFERRED_GEN.data>. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.

Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <vmodcam> :
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <USER_LOGIC_I/Inst_VmodCAM/Inst_camctlB/Inst_LocalRst/RstQ_4> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
